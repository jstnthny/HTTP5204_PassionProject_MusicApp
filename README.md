# Music Application

For my passion project I created a music application where 
users can find different songs, leave reviews for songs and search for songs based on their genres.

On the administrative side of things a logged in admin would be able to add new songs & genres to the website. The admin is also able to
view, add, edit and delete any song, genre or review. 

## Features 
* CRUD 
* Image Upload
* User Authorization
* Search 
* Responsive Design 

## Future Updates/Features
* Option to have multiple artists on a song
* Seperate accounts from users and admins 
* Users ability to update/delete their own review
* Ability to hear a short preview of a song
